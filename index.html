                <p class="intro-text">
                    Hi! I'm Shalom Julius, and I recently graduated from high school in Nigeria. I'll be starting my medical degree soon, which I'm really excited about. But beyond science and medicine, I've also gotten into web development over the past year. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I wanted to understand how websites work and build things myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's honestly been a fun challenge balancing both interests‚Äîmedicine and coding don't usually go together, but I think that's what makes it interesting. I'm curious about finding ways to use technology in healthcare, even if I'm still figuring out exactly what that looks like.

                    <h3>High School Excellence</h3>
                    <p>I just finished high school, where I focused heavily on the sciences‚Äîbiology, chemistry, physics‚Äîbasically everything I need for medicine. That's where my interest in the human body really started. I've always been the type to ask "why" and "how," so naturally, I got drawn to understanding how our bodies work and what happens when things go wrong.</p>

                <div class="journey-card">

                    <h3>SAT & Self-Development</h3>
                    <p>During my gap period before university, I took the SAT and did pretty well on it. More than the score itself, I learned a lot about discipline and managing my time effectively. I also used that time to explore web development. I started with basic HTML tutorials on YouTube and just kept going from there.</p>

                    <h3>Tech Exploration</h3>
                    <p>It's been a completely different kind of learning compared to school, but I enjoy it. Building something from scratch and watching it actually work is satisfying in a way that's hard to describe.</p>

                    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                    <p>Now, as I prepare to start university, I'm thinking about how I can combine what I'm learning in medicine with the tech skills I'm building. Maybe it's creating better ways to share medical information, or tools that make learning easier for other students. I'm not entirely sure yet, but I'm looking forward to exploring it.</p>
