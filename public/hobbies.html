                <p>When I'm not studying or coding, I try to do things that help me relax and stay creative. Here are some other things I enjoy doing:</p>

                    <h2>Music</h2>
                    <p>
                        I started playing the violin way back in primary school, and it's stuck with me ever since. It's one of those things that started as a school activity but became something I genuinely enjoy. I got my Grade 1 certification from ABRSM a while back, which was a real achievement at the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Playing music clears my head, especially after long hours of study. It has also taught me patience and self-discipline, which are essential in other areas of my life.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Reading</h2>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy reading ‚Äîbooks, random articles, and occasionally research papers. I'm naturally drawn to anything related to science, medicine, how technology works, or even psychology and human behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reading keeps me curious and helps me think more critically about things. It's also one of the reasons I got into web development‚ÄîI read about it, got interested, and decided to just try it out.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Building Things</h2>
                    <p>
                        I like working on small projects, especially digital ones. Lately, that's been web development. I'll watch tutorials, read documentation, and then just try to build something myself. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but that's part of the fun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's something really satisfying about starting with nothing and ending up with a website that actually functions. It's a different kind of problem-solving than what I do in school, but I enjoy the challenge.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Learning About Other Cultures</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've always been curious about how people from different places think and solve problems. I attended a UNESCO conference on cultural education and global citizenship, and it was honestly one of the most interesting experiences I've had.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It made me realize how much we can learn from each other when we take the time to listen and understand different perspectives. That kind of thinking has shaped how I approach everything‚Äîwhether it's academics, coding, or just conversations with people.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Helping People Learn</h2>
                    <p>
                        In school, I'd often help my classmates when they were struggling with science or math. I didn't think much of it at first, but I realized I actually enjoy teaching. Explaining something to someone else forces you to really understand it yourself, so it's a win-win.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think that's something I want to keep doing‚Äîwhether it's mentoring other students or finding ways to make learning easier for people through the things I build.
